# selenium- (ClassJoinInator)

A project for automating class joining process for students of Ngit.

## How to use ClassJoinInator

#### First time

- You need to download the [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and move it into the project directory where the 2 files are present!(for source code)

  - For using console app, the **chromdriver** should be in the same directory as the console app.

- If its the first time you use ClassJoinInator, you need to enter your credentials- (you need to do this only once, the credentials are stored), EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN ENTERING CREDENTIALS. 

- Then the backend code runs and join's the most recent class started.

#### Second time

- For the second time, it directly gets the credentials from the file located in *C:\Users\Public\credentials.txt* and joins the most recent class started.
