# selenium- (ClassJoinInator)

A project for automating class joining process for students of Ngit.

## How to use ClassJoinInator

#### First time

- you need to download the chromedriver and move it into the project directory where the 2 files are present!

- If its the first time you use ClassJoinInator, you need to enter your credentials- (you need to do this only once, the credentials are stored), EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN ENTERING CREDENTIALS. 

- Then the backend code runs and join's the most recent class started.

#### Second time

- For the second time, it directly gets the credentials from the file located in *C:\Users\Public\credentials.txt* and joins the most recent class started.

## Built with

- selenium - 3.141.0

- pyinstaller - 4.1 (for packaging python code)

- *chromdriver* is required to run and test source code, but the console app comes inbuilt with chromedriver.
